The gallows held the man who did, this treacherous monster finally rid, allowed a meal before his end, now his heart about to rend, beneath the subtle gaze of all, unannounced he began his recall, the events that unfolded in that narrow hall. 
Hap-stance those who viewed this vile act, endorsed by the sudden pact, even they shanâ€™t redact, the feelings that night were exact, unveiled this monsters frightful tact.

The soul shackled by the memory, the night in question eternally embedded, within the consciousness of those beheaded. The sound of life emptied fast, these noisy hallways silent at last, so full of joy in the past, these hallowed halls danced contrast. Among the bodies torn and tattered, a mosaic created from the blood that splattered, the pane of glass now fully shattered, juxtaposition the only word that flattered.

The beauty of travesty, within the sacred walls he lurch, truly a fitting end to church, now over he was in search, he lay beneath his lowly birch. His life no longer able acquitted, his right to life no longer permitted, he stand there in the gallows outfitted, ready his mind he already submitted, the life he gave for the life he took, sacrificing the pawn he took the rook, just to spite the big black book, and to imprint forever that solemn look, of the family his duties shook. The punishment for his crime, the inverse of gaining time, his life now over by design, how it ended was benign, for his beliefs now truly align, the dark lord has seen his sign.
